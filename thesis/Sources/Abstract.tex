\noindent
This thesis is about the implementation of the ChaCha plug-in in CrypTool 2.

\medskip
\noindent
The thesis introduces the ChaCha cipher family, explains what the plug-in is capable of, and gives insight into the development process of the plug-in.

\medskip
\noindent
ChaCha is used in the Transport Layer Security protocol (TLS) since 2014 and so very relevant for applied modern cryptography. Because of the importance of ChaCha its internal design should be made more accessible to the broader public. This is the actual goal of the plug-in.

\medskip
\noindent
The goal is achieved by focusing on an in-depth but easy to understand visualization of the encryption process.
CrypTool 2 is the most popular e-learning platform in the field of cryptology, used in schools, universities, and companies. Incorporating this plug-in into CrypTool 2 helps to reach a broad audience.
