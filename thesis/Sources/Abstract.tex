\noindent
This thesis is about the implementation of the ChaCha plug-in in CrypTool 2.

\medskip
\noindent
It explains what the plug-in is capable of and gives insight into the development process. The thesis also provides general information about the ChaCha cipher family.

\medskip
\noindent
Since ChaCha is used in the Transport Layer Security protocol (TLS) since 2014, it is very relevant for modern cryptography and thus its internal design should be made more accessible to the broader public. This is the actual goal of the plug-in. \\
The goal is achieved by focusing on an in-depth but easy to understand visualization of the encryption process. Implementing the plug-in into CrypTool 2, the most popular e-learning platform in the field of cryptology, which is used in schools, universities and companies, helps with reaching a broad audience.
