\end{center}

\noindent
This thesis is about the implementation of the ChaCha plug-in in CrypTool 2.

\medskip
\noindent
It explains what the plug-in is capable of and gives insight into the development process. The thesis also provides general information about the ChaCha cipher family.

\medskip
\noindent
Since ChaCha is used in TLS since 2014, it is very relevant for modern cryptography and thus how it works should be made more accessible to other cryptologists. This is the actual goal of this plug-in. It is achieved by focusing on an in-depth but easy to understand visualization of the encryption process.
